	abstract     = {Verbal communication in a ``cocktail-party situation'' is a major challenge for the auditory system. In particular, changes in target speaker usually result in declined speech perception. Here, we investigated whether speech cues indicating a subsequent change in target speaker reduce the costs of switching in younger and older adults. We employed event-related potential (ERP) measures and a speech perception task, in which sequences of short words were simultaneously presented by four speakers. Changes in target speaker were either unpredictable or semantically cued by a word within the target stream. Cued changes resulted in a less decreased performance than uncued changes in both age groups. The ERP analysis revealed shorter latencies in the change-related N400 and late positive complex (LPC) after cued changes, suggesting an acceleration in context updating and attention switching. Thus, both younger and older listeners used semantic cues to prepare changes in speaker setting.}

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

	abstract     = {Objective. The study of motor unit behavior has been classically performed by selective recording systems of muscle electrical activity (EMG signals) and decomposition algorithms able to discriminate between individual motor unit action potentials from multi-unit signals. In this study, we provide a general framework for the decomposition of multi-channel intramuscular and surface EMG signals and we extensively validate this approach with experimental recordings. Approach. First, we describe the conditions under which the assumptions of the convolutive blind separation model are satisfied. Second, we propose an approach of convolutive sphering of the observations followed by an iterative extraction of the sources. This approach is then validated using intramuscular signals recorded by novel multi-channel thin-film electrodes on the Abductor Digiti Minimi of the hand and Tibilias Anterior muscles, as well as on high-density surface EMG signals recorded by electrode grids on the First Dorsal Interosseous muscle. The validation was based on the comparison with the gold standard of manual decomposition (for intramuscular recordings) and on the two-source method (for comparison of intramuscular and surface EMG recordings) for the three human muscles and contraction forces of up to 90\% MVC. Main results. The average number of common sources identified for the validation was 14 \pm{} 7 (averaged across all trials and subjects and all comparisons), with a rate of agreement in their discharge timings of 92.8 \pm{} 3.2\%. The average Decomposability Index, calculated on the automatic decomposed signals, was 16.0 \pm{} 2.2 (7.3–44.1). For comparison, the same index calculated on the manual decomposed signals was 15.0 \pm{} 3.0 (6.3–76.6). Significance. These results show that the method provides a solid framework for the decomposition of multi-channel invasive and non-invasive EMG signals that allows the study of the behavior of a large number of concurrently active motor units.}

These networks have previously been seen primarily as a means of representing knowledge derived from experts. Here it is shown that the ``Gibbs sampling'' simulation procedure for such networks can support maximum-likelihood learning from empirical data through local gradient ascent. This learning procedure resembles that used for ``Boltzmann machines'', and like it, allows the use of ``hidden'' variables to model correlations between visible variables. Due to the directed nature of the connections in a belief network, however, the ``negative phase'' of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid belief network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, are naturally applicable to unsupervised learning problems, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge.}

The key computational unit of a deep network is a linear projection followed by a point-wise non-linearity, which is typically a logistic function. In this work, we show that we can improve generalization and make training of deep networks faster and simpler by substituting the logistic units with rectified linear units. These units are linear when their input is positive and zero otherwise. In a supervised setting, we can successfully train very deep nets from random initialization on a large vocabulary speech recognition task achieving lower word error rates than using a logistic network with the same topology. Similarly in an unsupervised setting, we show how we can learn sparse features that can be useful for discriminative tasks. All our experiments are executed in a distributed environment using several hundred machines and several hundred hours of speech data.},

This estimate is equal to the mutual information between two hypothetical signals at either end of a simplified model of human communication. Listening tests show that the modification improves the prediction accuracy of STOI at all performance levels on both long and short utterances.

	abstract     = {Recent neural network strategies for source separation attempt to model audio signals by processing their waveforms directly. Mean squared error (MSE) that measures the Euclidean distance between waveforms of denoised speech and the ground-truth speech, has been a natural cost-function for these approaches. However, MSE is not a perceptually motivated measure and may result in large perceptual discrepancies. In this paper, we propose and experiment with new loss functions for end-to-end source separation. These loss functions are motivated by BSS\_Eval and perceptual metrics like source to distortion ratio (SDR), source to interference ratio (SIR), source to artifact ratio (SAR) and short-time objective intelligibility ratio (STOI). This enables the flexibility to mix and match these loss functions depending upon the requirements of the task. Subjective listening tests reveal that combinations of the proposed cost functions help achieve superior separation performance as compared to stand-alone MSE and SDR costs.},

Besides reducing time and costs compared to real listening experiments, an objective intelligibility measure could also help provide answers on how to improve the intelligibility of noisy unprocessed speech. In this paper, a short-time objective intelligibility measure (STOI) is presented, which shows high correlation with the intelligibility of noisy and time-frequency weighted noisy speech (e.g., resulting from noise reduction) of three different listening experiments. In general, STOI showed better correlation with speech intelligibility compared to five other reference objective intelligibility models. In contrast to other conventional intelligibility models which tend to rely on global statistics across entire sentences, STOI is based on shorter time segments (386 ms). Experiments indeed show that it is beneficial to take segment lengths of this order into account. In addition, a free Matlab implementation is provided.},

	abstract     = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

While often effective, this decoupling requires specifying two separate models, each with their own complexities, and prevents capturing more nuanced long-range spatiotemporal relationships. We propose a unified approach, as demonstrated by our Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), that hierarchically captures relationships at low-, intermediate-, and high-level time-scales. Our model achieves superior or competitive performance using video or sensor data on three public action segmentation datasets and can be trained in a fraction of the time it takes to train an RNN.}

PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\% [33]).

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

This paper deciphers ResNet by analyzing the effect of skip connections, and puts forward new theoretical results on the advantages of identity skip connections in neural networks. We prove that the skip connections in the residual blocks facilitate preserving the norm of the gradient, and lead to stable back-propagation, which is desirable from optimization perspective. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, as more residual blocks are stacked, the norm-preservation of the network is enhanced. Our theoretical arguments are supported by extensive empirical evidence. Can we push for extra norm-preservation? We answer this question by proposing an efficient method to regularize the singular values of the convolution operator and making the ResNet's transition layers extra norm-preserving. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the learning dynamics and the classification performance of ResNet can be improved by making it even more norm preserving. Our results and the introduced modification for ResNet, referred to as Procrustes ResNets, can be used as a guide for training deeper networks and can also inspire new deeper architectures.},

A new model has therefore been developed for use across a wider range of network conditions, including analogue connections, codecs, packet loss and variable delay. Known as perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), it is the result of integration of the perceptual analysis measurement system (PAMS) and PSQM99, an enhanced version of PSQM. PESQ is expected to become a new ITU-T recommendation P.862, replacing P.861 which specified PSQM and MNB.},
